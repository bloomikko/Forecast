# Forecast
iOS (iPhone) app for showing current weather and forecast based on user's current location. Created by following Mark Price's iOS 10/Swift 3 course on Udemy, but added some own features and redesigned UI. Uses OpenWeatherMap for weather information. Feel free to comment or suggest new features!
